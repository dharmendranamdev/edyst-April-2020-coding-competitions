If you're like me, books are a refuge. I don't discriminate when it comes to a good story, whether on my Nook, my Pixel 3 ($950 at Best Buy) or on the paper page. I love finding a good story and that stays with me long after I finish the last chapter. But when you're reading several books a month, getting new titles the easy way, from Amazon or the bookstore, gets to be an expensive hobby. That's where free digital libraries come in.

Thanks to the internet, the concept of a personal library is changing. It used to be that paper books lined endless shelves. With the rise of Amazon and its Kindle, the convenience of buying books to read on a device took over. Free-lending libraries, which are celebrating National Library Week in the US, have moved online, too, alongside brick-and-mortar libraries that are reinventing themselves to stay relevant in the digital age. Today, dozens of websites and apps offer everything from contemporary indie fiction to Elizabethan classics without charging you a penny.

Here are 10 good ways of getting books for free on your desktop, laptop, phone or tablet, without breaking copyright law (and we know you never would).
